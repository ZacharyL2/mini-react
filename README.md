# Introduce

I used the [tic-tac-toe tutorial example](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html#what-are-we-building) provided by Reactâ€™s official website and can see that it works perfectly. In addition, it currently supports function components and class components, which may meet 80% of your needs! 

This is what I created after reading a lot of [React](https://github.com/facebook/react)'s source code, it's basically the same as React in overall logic and function naming, if you're interested in React's internals, it's for you!
